    <h3 class="full1">DESIGN PROBLEM</h3>
		<h4 class="full1">Gaining and implementing leadership skills can be hard. We usually listen to XX or going to a leadership training by demand with our work department colleagues. We‚Äôll learn X, Y, and Z that make sense at the moment, but when it comes to implementation the reality is does not match the predefined situation.
			<br>
			<br>
		Not only the training are being forgotten, sooner or later, the worksheet from leadership training are also being lost in the piles of working files. As part of the Technology and Innovation team on Career Development Department we created a Leadership Hub acting as a portal for knowledge sharing and collaboration, it aims to stimulate leadership development across the UN system. Helping to inspire solutions within the UN working environment.</h4>
		<!-- <div class="right1">
		<p>In ‚ÄúShifting the management paradigm in the United Nations: ensuring a better future for all,‚Äù the Secretary-General has indicated that the Organization‚Äôs culture and leadership have become increasingly centralized, bureaucratic, and risk-averse‚Äîand that critical to our success‚Äîis the profound transformation of our culture and leadership.</p>

		<p>Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres said that ‚ÄúLeadership and management development programmes (‚Ä¶) will be adjusted to reflect the leadership framework and will be more closely aligned with organizational expectations and performance management.‚Äù He has stressed that the leadership of the Organization must be strengthened and empowered and has instructed the implementation of the United Nations System Leadership Framework (UNSLF) to be integrated into leadership and management development programmes.</p>

	<h3 style="margin-top: 20em;" class="full1">RESEARCH + PAINPOINTS</h3>
		<h4 class="left1">We have used the Staff Survey from 2018 to address the current challenges in 	the management culture and leadership. There are 116 respondents across UN entities and we identify 30 key painpoints and unmet user needs.
		<br>
		<br>
		We are able to determin our objectives from the user painpoints. First, the resources on the Leadership Hub are designed to support performance at the point of need. Second, the contents should be practical, accessible, engaging, and visual. Examples include videos, checklists, infographics, quick guides, blogs, tips, and common mistakes.
			At last, contents should dircetly relates to employee evaluation factors</h4>

		<h3 style="margin-top: 20em;" class="full1">NEW LEADERSHIP & MANAGEMENT COMPETENCIES </h3>
		<h4 class="full1">The new Management and Leadership Competency Framework for the Secretariat draws from the eight leadership principles and four ways of working outlined in the UNSLF, as well as the ninth leadership principle given by the Secretary-General. The framework transforms these principles from aspirational goals into measurable behaviours that can be observed, evaluated and developed.</h4>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 20em" class="full1">USER TEST + ITERATION</h3>
		<h4 class="full2">After building a few pages, we sent a survey to ask the previous user research participants to test the flow and the content of our hi-fidelity mockup. The survey included multiple-choice questions, suggestion comment boxes, and semantic differential scale with 7 options between "easy" to "not at all".
			<br>
			<br>
		The survey came back with all postive feedback. However, I realized that more than half of the participants did not finish their survey. The survey was designed for 10-15 minutes in length and was stated in the invitation email in bold and at the beginning of Survey Monkey to warned about the time needed.
			<br>
		<br>

		The content page was adjusted to target a shorter requirements in attention span.</h4>

	<h3 style="margin-top: 20em" class="full1">MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT</h3>
		<h4 class="full2">An incident has happened before our physical meeting with one of our key stakeholders. Both of our content team and engineering team was off-board. So we have to quickly redefine our MVP. In the end, we have settled with a WordPress solution with a purchase of a template and merged with our user flow to test launch the 1 phase.</h4>

		<h4 class="left1">Empower organization-first thinking¬†with¬†user-first thinking </h4>
		<p class="right1">To build a¬†learning¬†platform, it was critical to work¬†with¬†the organizational deliverable needs and user needs. We vision the project to have multiple entities involved, but each entity‚Äôs annual deliverables are not publicly shared. Through a series of reaching out to different departments, we not only informed them about the project, but also better aligned organizational needs with user needs.</p>

		<h4 class="left1">React to unexpected limitations and sudden events </h4>
		<p class="right1">Things does not always go how we planned, but problem does not have to be solved in one single way too. Communication and flexibility are the key to problem solving. I learned to rapid problem solve in and have quick turnarounds in sudden situations.
